This repo provides a simple tool to compile all important files in your project into a single Markdown or text file â€” perfect for sharing with an LLM.

It includes a visual structure tree and collapsible code sections for easy navigation.

Use the CLI (`compile.py`) or the convenient GUI (`gui_launcher.py`) which wraps it.

As an example, see `this_repo.md`, which showcases this tool applied this very repo itself.

Just clone the repo and run:
```bash
python3 gui_launcher.py
```
