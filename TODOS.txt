- I want to create a new config with name corresponding to each new compilation name, so that if you have different projects compiled,
you'd not lose the config of the projects...

- Options to exclude specific files

- A statistics display showing how many files of each type, and how much total content of each set of file types


- If possible, a way to chunk the project better into managable sizes, to suite it to the context window of LLMs
